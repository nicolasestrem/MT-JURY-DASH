Decisions and assumptions (short lines)
- Scope limited to `Plugin/` directory for source review.
- Treat `MT_Public_Assets` as the preferred owner for v4 enqueues.
- Report-only: no changes outside `ops/audit/frontend-ui`.
- Use ripgrep results for line references; ranges approximate when files large.
