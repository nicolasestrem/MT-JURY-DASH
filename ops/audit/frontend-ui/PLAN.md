Plan
- Goals: Identify CSS/JS conflicts, duplication, and perf wins.
- Files to read first: `Plugin/includes/core/class-mt-plugin.php`, `Plugin/includes/public/class-mt-public-assets.php`, `Plugin/assets/css/v4/*`, `Plugin/assets/js/*`.
- Risks to watch: v4 vs legacy conflicts; double event handlers; Elementor overrides; excessive `!important`.
