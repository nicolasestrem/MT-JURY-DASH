fix: Resolve fatal error in admin and fix debug center

This commit resolves a fatal error that was occurring in the admin area due to a missing `class-mt-debug-manager.php` file.

- Removes the `require_once` call to the missing file in `class-mt-admin.php`.
- Creates a new `debug-center.php` template to render the debug center tabs, excluding the broken "Scripts" tab.
- Updates the "Tools" tab in the debug center to use `wp_get_environment_type()` instead of the missing `MT_Debug_Manager`.

This also resolves the issue of the "Data Migration" tool not being visible in the admin menu, as the fatal error was preventing the menu from rendering correctly.
