fix: Address critical issues from PR review

This commit addresses several critical and medium priority issues identified during code review.

High Priority Fixes:
- Fixes a WP-CLI command registration conflict for the candidate migration command.
- Corrects data integrity issues in exports by using consistent join keys for the `mt_candidates` table.
- Fixes a JSON serialization bug in the data migration scripts where array data was not being correctly encoded.

Medium Priority Fixes:
- Hides the legacy `mt_candidate` Custom Post Type from the admin UI to reflect its deprecation.
